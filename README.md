# bliss-docker

Lightweight Docker container with [bliss](https://www.blisshq.com/), loosely based on [romancin/bliss-docker](https://github.com/romancin/bliss-docker).  Compared to that project, this one has two primary functional differences:

1. The container process runs as a non-root user.  Running as a non-root user helps ensure that config files can be accessed from outside the container without root permissions; and it is useful for security, as it limits the impact of any potential container breakout exploit.  Running simple containers as non-root users is already possible using `docker run -u <user>`, but starting as root and dropping privileges has some advantages, including:
    - Running as a non-root user becomes the default;
    - Permissions on the config volume can be changed automatically at startup;
    - The specified UID/GID combination need not correspond with an actual user on the host.
2. The runner script (which exists to ensure that the container doesn't exit when bliss restarts across an upgrade) traps various signals and passes them on to the bliss process.  In particular this includes SIGTERM which is issued by Docker when a container is stopped.  This permits a clean shutdown of the container.

This image is also almost 30% smaller.

The primary repository for this project is on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/cooperised/bliss-docker/) and uses a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for automated image builds.  The version on [GitHub](https://github.com/cooperised/bliss-docker/) is a mirror.

## Latest version

![Docker Image Version (latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/cooperised/bliss) ![docker size](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/cooperised/bliss) 

New releases of bliss will trigger an automated image rebuild within 24 hours, so a fresh pull of the image will generally contain the latest version.  bliss can be upgraded within the container from its own web UI, and settings will be preserved across the upgrade.

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Debian Bullseye x86_64 hosts.  Not built or tested for any other host architecture, but it would likely work.  Open an issue if you'd like to request this.

## Instructions 
- Map any local port to 3220 for web access
- Map any local port to 3221 (used for bliss internal web server)
- Map a local volume to /config (Stores configuration data)
- Map a local volume to wherever you like, perhaps /music (This is the directory wher you should put your music for bliss to scan, and you can select it on first startup)
- Choose the user and group IDs that bliss should run under, and pass these using the `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables

The container will run with the effective UID and GID provided.  If these are omitted it will run with `UID=65534 (nobody)` and `GID=65534 (nogroup)`.  

Sample run command, running as the existing host user `user`:

```bash
docker run -d --name=bliss \
-v /share/Container/bliss:/config \
-v /share/MyMusic:/music \
-v /path/to/store/license/:/root/.java \
-e PGID=`id -u user` -e PUID=`id -g user` \
-e TZ=Europe/London \
-p 3220:3220 \
-p 3221:3221 \
patsaindon/docker-bliss:latest
```
